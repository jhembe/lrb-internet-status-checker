## LRB Internet Status Checker

This is a simple web application that allows students at a university to check the availability of the internet in the LRB classes without having to physically go to the location. The application consists of a PHP script that checks the status of the internet connection in the LRB classes, and a user interface that displays the status in real-time. The interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be modern, immersive, and user-friendly.

Features:
- Real-time status updates of LRB internet availability.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Continuously monitors the status of the LRB internet connection and updates the UI accordingly.
- Responsive design that works well on different screen sizes.

This project is intended to make it easier for students to determine whether or not they need to make the trip to the LRB classes to access the internet, saving them time and effort. The code is open-source and can be easily customized to work with other network configurations.
